# Boids simulation
### Artificial Intelligence Elective 2023

This is a 2D flock simulation developed in Unity. It uses the Boids algorithm - group behaviour based on three forces: Separation, Alignment and Cohesion. The application has UI tools that affect the values and weights of the simulation, making it interactable and easy to experiment with. Elements of my code are inspired by Sebastian Lague's Boids project.
